# Sign-up/Login System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing a robust sign-up and login system for the portfolio website. The system will be designed to be secure, scalable, and integrated seamlessly with the existing application.

## 1. Backend Development

### 1.1 API Endpoints
- **User Registration:** Create an endpoint (`/api/auth/register`) to handle new user sign-ups. This will involve: 
  - Validating user input (email, password, etc.).
  - Hashing passwords securely (e.g., using bcrypt).
  - Storing user data in a database.
- **User Login:** Create an endpoint (`/api/auth/login`) for user authentication. This will involve:
  - Verifying user credentials against stored hashes.
  - Generating and returning a JSON Web Token (JWT) or session token upon successful authentication.
- **User Logout:** Implement an endpoint (`/api/auth/logout`) to invalidate sessions or tokens.
- **User Profile (Optional):** An endpoint (`/api/user/profile`) to fetch or update user-specific data, requiring authentication.

### 1.2 Database Integration
- Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing user information.
- Define a schema for the `User` model, including fields like `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
- Implement database connection and CRUD operations for user management.

### 1.3 Authentication Strategy
- **JWT-based Authentication:** Implement JWTs for stateless authentication. This involves:
  - Signing JWTs on login.
  - Verifying JWTs on subsequent requests.
  - Storing JWTs securely on the client-side (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies).
- **Session-based Authentication (Alternative):** If preferred, implement server-side sessions.

### 1.4 Password Hashing
- Utilize a strong, industry-standard password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) to store passwords securely. **Never store plain-text passwords.**

## 2. Frontend Development

### 2.1 UI Components
- **Login Form:** Create a React component for user login with fields for email/username and password.
- **Sign-up Form:** Create a React component for user registration with fields for email, password, and password confirmation.
- **Dashboard/Protected Routes:** Components that are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Navigation Updates:** Dynamically show/hide login/logout links based on authentication status.

### 2.2 State Management
- Use React Context API, Redux, Zustand, or similar for managing authentication state (e.g., `isLoggedIn`, `user`, `token`).
- Store user tokens/sessions securely (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for JWTs, or rely on HTTP-only cookies for sessions).

### 2.3 API Integration
- Develop service functions to interact with the backend authentication API endpoints.
- Handle successful responses (e.g., storing tokens, redirecting users).
- Handle error responses (e.g., displaying error messages to the user).

### 2.4 Route Protection
- Implement client-side route guards to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected routes.
- Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

### 2.5 Error Handling and Feedback
- Provide clear and concise error messages for invalid credentials, network issues, etc.
- Implement loading indicators during API calls.

## 3. Security Considerations

- **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS:** Ensure all communication between frontend and backend is over HTTPS.
- **CORS:** Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) if frontend and backend are on different domains.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **XSS/CSRF Protection:** Implement measures against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

## 4. Integration with Existing Application

- **Webpack Configuration:** Ensure Webpack is correctly configured to handle new React components and API calls.
- **Three.js Context:** Determine if any Three.js specific interactions or data need to be tied to user authentication (e.g., saving user-specific 3D scene configurations).
- **Server-side Integration:** Integrate the new authentication routes into the existing `server/index.ts`.

## Inspiration from ryOS (https://github.com/ryokun6/ryos)

While `ryos` is a different type of application (web-based OS), we can draw inspiration from its architecture for robust web application development:

- **Modular Structure:** `ryos` appears to have a well-organized, modular structure. We should aim for a similar separation of concerns for our authentication module (e.g., `auth` folder for routes, controllers, services).
- **State Management:** Observe how `ryos` manages application state, especially for user interactions and persistent data. This can inform our choice and implementation of frontend state management for user authentication.
- **API Design:** While `ryos` might not have explicit login/signup, its interaction with backend services (if any) can provide insights into designing clean and efficient API communication.
- **Security Practices:** Review any security-related implementations in `ryos` (e.g., handling of sensitive data, API key management) to ensure best practices are followed in our authentication system.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the sign-up/login system. We will proceed with these steps, adapting as necessary based on specific project requirements and existing codebase structure.
