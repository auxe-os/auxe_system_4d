# auxeOS Agency Website Ideas

Transforming this portfolio into a unique website for your agency "auxeOS" is a great idea. The 3D interactive format offers many creative possibilities. Here are some suggestions, blending the concept of "agency docs" with an engaging user experience:

### Branding & Visuals

1.  **Custom 3D Environment:**
    *   Replace the current desk setup with a 3D model of your actual office or an idealized "auxeOS" workspace.
    *   Incorporate your agency's logo (`auxeOS`) as a 3D object on the desk or wall.
2.  **Brand Colors & Style:**
    *   Update the color palette in `src/UI/style.css` and the 3D textures in `static/models/` to match your agency's branding.
    *   Change the font used in the UI components (`src/UI/components/`) to align with your brand's typography.

### Content & Features ("The Docs")

1.  **Interactive Service Showcase:**
    *   Make objects on the desk clickable. For example, clicking a 3D model of a pencil could open a modal describing your "Design" services, and a keyboard could detail your "Development" services. This logic could be added to `src/Application/World/World.ts`.
2.  **Portfolio on the Virtual Monitor:**
    *   Use the computer screen (`src/Application/World/MonitorScreen.ts`) to showcase your portfolio. Visitors could click through a gallery of case studies, with videos or project descriptions appearing on the screen.
3.  **"Meet the Team" Easter Eggs:**
    *   Replace the decor items with objects representing your team members. Clicking an object could reveal a team member's bio, social links, or a fun fact.
4.  **Client Testimonials Radio:**
    *   Modify the radio to play short audio clips of client testimonials instead of music. The audio files are in `static/audio/radio/`.

### Interactive Ideas

1.  **"Agency OS" Terminal:**
    *   Enhance the virtual monitor to feature a fake command-line interface. Visitors could type commands like `ls ./services` or `cat ./case-studies/project-a` to explore your agency's information in a fun, interactive way.
2.  **Gamified Onboarding:**
    *   Create a simple "scavenger hunt" where the user has to find clues in the 3D scene to "unlock" a full project proposal or access a hidden demo.
