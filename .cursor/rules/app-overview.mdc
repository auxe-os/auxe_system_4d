# auxe.co Portfolio Website - Application Overview

This application is an interactive 3D portfolio website that simulates a desktop environment. Users can interact with a virtual computer setup, including a monitor that displays various web content.

**Key Technologies:**

-   **Three.js:** For 3D rendering and scene management.
-   **React/TypeScript:** For building the user interface components.
-   **Three.js/Post-processing Shaders:** For visual effects (e.g., coffee steam, screen effects).
-   **Web Audio API:** For interactive sound effects and ambient audio.
-   **CSS3DRenderer:** For embedding HTML content (iframes) within the 3D scene.

**Core Functionality:**

-   **Interactive 3D Environment:** Users can navigate a virtual room with a computer desk.
-   **Dynamic Monitor Content:** The virtual monitor can display different web pages/applications via iframes.
-   **Audio Feedback:** Sound effects for user interactions (mouse clicks, keyboard typing) and ambient background audio.
-   **Camera Controls:** Transitions between different camera views (idle, desk, monitor, free cam).
-   **Loading Screen:** Displays progress during asset loading and a WebGL compatibility check.

**Development Guidelines:**

-   **Performance:** Optimize 3D assets, shaders, and React components for smooth performance.
-   **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is responsive and functional across different screen sizes, especially for UI elements.
-   **Maintainability:** Write clean, modular, and well-commented code. Follow existing patterns for Three.js scene management and React component structure.
-   **User Experience:** Focus on intuitive interactions and clear visual/audio feedback.
